   <p>Super Monkey Ball: Step 'n Roll is a marble puzzle game with 7 worlds of 10 stages each. While Super Monkey Ball 2 repeated the same theme during an entire world, Step 'n Roll has an innovative variation in its background music.</p>
   <p>Each stage in a world has a few audio clips that represent a few measures of music, and these clips play in sequence and then repeat. When the player moves on to the next stage, the current audio clip finishes playing, and then the engine begins playing the sequence of clips for that next stage. Because each clip represents a complete musical phrase, the clips flow smoothly together and the player is never jarred by suddenly shifting music.</p>
